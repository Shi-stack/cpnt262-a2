***Short Summary:*** Created Dynamic Image Gallery with all different file name html file script.js in seperate JS folder and same with CSS.

You will see so many of comments in all files.Actually I have tried doing acessing all file individually and then i have created loop. I have not removed the simple way of accessing image just for future reference.

Coming to loops.. To create a loop is not difficult as per your guidance tony. But yes I got stuck because of syntax error and was not getting output.

Vitaly helped me out and also he showed me the way to acess all the object items to access in one go which was way easy than what I was trying to do.
